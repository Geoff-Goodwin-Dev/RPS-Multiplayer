# Rock Paper Scissors - Web-based Multi-Player Edition

* **Created:** Saturday, March 26th, 2018

* **Context:** This is the seventh week's homework assignment as a part of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, we are constructing an updated version of the Rock Paper Scissors game with multi-player functionality using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Firebase. The primary focus of the assignment is an understanding of the utility of Firebase as a plug-and-play database solution for real-time, always open integration with the front-end.  The homework's high level instructions are as follows:

```
In this assignment, you'll indeed create another Rock Paper Scissors game. The catch? You're going to make this an online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase (and the rest of your web development repertoire)!
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
